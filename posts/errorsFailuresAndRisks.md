# Errors Failures and Risks

The plot of Starship Troopers centers around one major failure and  
the devastation it caused. When the pilots and technology of their  
spaceship fail to avoid the asteroid headed towards earth, the communications  
array on the ship is destroyed. Since this was their only way to communicate  
with Earth, the ship was unable to give Earth a warning about the approaching  
asteroid. Additionally, once the asteroid arrived, the orbital defense system in  
place around earth failed to detect the asteroid in advance or destroy it and thus  
an entire city was destroyed by the impact.
