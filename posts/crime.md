# Crime  

Crime is not largely addressed in the Starship Troopers, however there are a couple of instances of crime throughout  
the movie. For example in the beginning of the movie it is mentioned that they caught a murderer who they tried and  
executed on the same day and the execution is televised on all channels and on the internet. It is also explained that  
there is significantly less crime in this society because of the harsh punishments they administer for crimes. 

Additionally, later in the movie, when Johnny accidentally gets one of his squad mates killed, they administer corporal    
punishment to him giving him 10 lashes which everyone is forced to watch. This shows that the punishments for crime has  
not changed significantly as a result of the changes in technology.
