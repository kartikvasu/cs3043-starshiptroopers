#Background
In the 23rd century, humanity, under the leadership of the one world government called 'the Federation', which is a military 
democracy, has developed faster-than-light-travel and is colonizing the galaxy. They have encountered a species of
spacefaring eusocial insects which the humans call 'Arachnids'. They do not have technology but have physically evolved to accomplish
many tasks humans use technology for, including warfare. The human federation believes that the arachnids are not intelligent, and ask
colonists to stay away from their space. 

#Part 1
Starship troopers follows the life of a young man, Johnny Rico, who graduates high school and enlists in a 
futuristic military unit called the 'Mobile Infantry'. He does this against his parents' wishes but with the 
support of his friends Carl and Camren, who are also joining, and his stoic philosophy teacher. We observe
Carmen go through pilot training and Johnny go through military bootcamp. The bootcamp sequence satirizes 
elements like stern drill seregants and barracks life that are common in other movies. 

Johnny is promoted to squad leader and leads a live-fire training exercise. During this exercise one of his
subordinates is killed. Johnny receives corporal punishment and decides to quit training and return to his home. 
However at the same moment, his camp receives word that the Arachnids launched an "unprovoked" attack on Earth
by launching a single asteroid at it. The asteroid strikes Buenos Aires, Johnny's home. Enraged, he rescinds his 
resignation and joins the human attack on the Arachnids' homeworld of Klendathu. 

#Part 2
The attack is a complete failure, caused by the Federation's gross underestimation of the Arachnids' military power. 
Johnny is badly injured and mistakenly reported as killed in action.
