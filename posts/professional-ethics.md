# Professional Ethics
One area of professional ethics that was explored was that of the soldier, Johnny Rico, being punished for the mistakes of people that he was in charge of. When Rico is promoted to squad leader one of his subordinates- a squad member, is killed in a live-fire training. He is immediately held responsible for this and is flogged in addition to being demoted. The area of professional ethics this touches is on is that of responsibility. That is, instead of flogging the squad member that actually fired the shot, the squad leader was punished.
