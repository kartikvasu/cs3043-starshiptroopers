- Work - Wyatt

## Presentation Draft:
- Overview
- Conclusion: Starship Troopers satirizes militarism
- Computing Technologies
- Freedom of speech 
    - Soldiers (and leaders) instantly conclude the ‘bugs’ are evil
- Privacy: no character ever has anything to hide. 
- Fascist references
    - Carl wears an SS uniform
    - Eagle symbolism, like the holy roman Empire and imperial and nazi germany
    - Movie is intentionally ‘bad’, i.e. low production value, to mock Hollywood’s mostly positive treatment of militarism
    - The combat scenes have stupid choreography and gore, and some of the sci-fi elements are intentionally dumb, to mock what the writers see as dumb elements of more serious movies
    - How much evidence that hollywood’s treatment of militarism is mostly positive do we need to give?
    - Counterpoint/response: it’s actually serious, so it’s not satire, it’s war propaganda
